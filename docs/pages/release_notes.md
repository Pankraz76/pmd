### üöÄ New and noteworthy

#### Collections exposed as XPath attributes

Up to now, all AST node getters would be exposed to XPath, as long as the return type was a primitive (boxed or unboxed), String or Enum. That meant that collections, even of these basic types, were not exposed, so for instance accessing Apex's `ASTUserClass.getInterfaceNames()` to list the interfaces implemented by a class was impossible from XPath, and would require writing a Java rule to check it.

Since this release, PMD will also expose any getter returning a collection of any supported type as a sequence through an XPath attribute. They would require to use apropriate XQuery functions to manipulate the sequence. So for instance, to detect any given `ASTUserClass` in Apex that implements `Queueable`, it is now possible to write:

```xml
/UserClass[@InterfaceNames = 'Queueable']
```

#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
